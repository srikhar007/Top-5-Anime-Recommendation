        <a HREF="https://hianime.to/watch/one-piece-100?ep=2142"><img src="./assets/images/1346850.png" /></a>
        
        <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled in 109 tankōbon volumes as of July 2024.
            The series follows the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates as they quest in search of the "One Piece", a fabled prestige treasure that might elevate their captain, Monkey D. Luffy, to be "The King of the Pirates".
            One Piece easily outdoes Naruto in terms of both quality and quantity. While Naruto has several fan-loved, compelling characters, the cast of One Piece is much more extensive and diverse. The same goes for the designs for said characters as well.

        <a href="https://hianime.to/watch/naruto-677?ep=12352"><img src="./assets/images/647520.jpg"/></a>
        <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village.
            Naruto's perpetual popularity stems from its accessibility, beloved characters, and the perfect formula for anime and manga that stands the test of time. The underdog characters in Naruto, like Naruto himself and Hinata, are easy to root for, creating a satisfying narrative.
            There are three sets of the Naruto series, Naruto with nine seasons, Naruto Shippuden with 21 seasons and Boruto: Naruto Next Generations with four seasons which consist of ten episodes. This YouTube video celebrates the 20th Anniversary of Naruto. The show streams on Netflix.

        <h2 style="font-family:Timmana,sans-serif;">5.Demon Slayer</h2>
        <a href="https://hianime.to/watch/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-47?ep=1279"><img src="./assets/images/1329940.jpeg"/></a>
        <p>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Koyoharu Gotouge. It was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from February 2016 to May 2020, with its chapters collected in 23 tankōbon volumes. 
            It was a pretty violent show but is not as gory as other animes. I think it deserves it's MA15+ but would be okay for some children if they are mature and have watched other animes. And besides the anime is not that graphic in violence.
            That being said, the episodes are fantastic. Amazing fight sequences and animation, a subplot that nearly makes you cry, and of course getting viewers excited for the upcoming season. Absolutely worth seeing in the short window that it will be in the theater.
